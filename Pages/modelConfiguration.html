        <b>Two Servers Model:</b> <br>
        The two servers model expands upon the single server model by adding an additional server in parallel. This model consists of a single queue with two servers. Tasks from the queue are placed into the next available server for processing. Adjustable parameters for this model are interarrival rate and distribution as well as server processing rate and distribution for each of the two servers. This type of model could be experienced at barbershops, a customer checks in (is enqueued) then gets service from one of many potential barbers
